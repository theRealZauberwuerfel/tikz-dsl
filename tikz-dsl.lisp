;;; I also want to support feynman and chemfig since they are based on TikZ.

;;; It's cool, because writing such a DSL is mostly just putting strings together.
;;; Since we have the powerful FORMAT DSL plus CLOS and everything of CL (even macro capability!),
;;; also complex tasks become quite easy doable.

;;; CLOS offers not just normal methods with meta- and multiple inheritance, but also
;;; some stuff named :BEFORE and :AFTER methods.
;;; They substitute the primary methods and keep them clean and transparent.

;;; I learned (after YEARS and playing with PSTricks) about TikZ and how to use it
;;; from a video course of Edi Weitz at HAW. Thanks!
